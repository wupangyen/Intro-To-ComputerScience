Machine Language:
So a machine language is directly understand by the computer, it uses binary notation written as 1s and 0s 
Here is one example what a program instruction in machine language look like:
 10010101100101001111101010011011100101

It’s very difficult for human to understand so that’s why we develop 
High level languages like Java

High Level Language:

On the other hand high level languages is a programming using English and math symbols 

To get a feeling of what high level language look like here is a example 

So imagine we time travel back  at the New Year’s Eve in vision conference  if the count down number on the screen gets to 0 it screen will show Happy New Year !
We start count from 10 if it’s not 0 yet we subtract one 

Counter = 10 

While (Counter >=0){
 Count = count - 1
 If (counter==0){
 Print Happy New Year !
 }
}

This is much easier than 0s and 1s in binary code
