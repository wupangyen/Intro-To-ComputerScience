What is a loop:

loop is a sequence of instruction that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
Go back to the New Year count down example I show you previously notice here I used a while loop
Below is the syntax of a while loop
	counter = 10
	while(counter >= 0){

	}

in this case the instructions inside {} will continually repeated until the condition inside () is not true anymore in this case, 
when counter become negative numbers the loop will stop repeating

What is a function (also called method):
Function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.
The function contains instructions used to create the output from its input 

Here is a example of a function:

	myNameIs(name){
 	 print("Hi my name is" + name)
	}

so here is a function, what it does is you can put any name in () as input
for example if I put in Shiori as the input name 

so we called this function below
myNameIs(Shiori)
this function will print out "Hi my name is Shiori"
i
f it's
myNameIs(Pang)
It will output "Hi my name is Pang"

What is conditional statements:

If/Else is a form of conditional statements, it tells the computer that if the condition is true
,do this. Else, if the condition is false, do another thing

Go back to the New Year Count down example

inside the while loop I used a If statement

			
		if(count == 0) {
			System.out.print("Happy New Year");
			count = count -1;
			
		}
		else {
			count = count -1;
		}

so this is saying if the count equals 0 then we print Happy New Year on the Screen
else when the count still greater than 0 we keep subtract 1
